            <h4>Button Clicker</h4>
            <p>
                Button Clicker, is kind of like Cookie Clicker. And if anyone out there does not know what Cookie Clicker. It is a
                game (web, and mobile), that is catergorized as an idle game. An idle game, is where you advance through the game, 
                both by accually playing the game, or by letting the game idle in the background.

            <h4>Clicker Counter</h4>
            <p>
                Clicker Counter, is a 'game' (not really, but yes), where the 'player' clicks a button. The number of clicks is counted, 
                and shown on screen. The player gets an 'achievement', every time they reach a pre-determined milestone of clicks. Each
                achievement is filled with just the right amount of sarcasm, so that the 'game' is not to bland.
